# TASK MANAGEMENT APPLICATION

This application has been built for the users to be able to sort their everyday tasks with ease.

It has multiple features like - create, edit, add description, delete and etc. We can also add an appropriate image URL for a specific task and write a short description about it as well.
It will help users to manage their tasks and keep a track on every task.

I've built this application using html, css and javascript. `Javascript` allows me to add functionality to this application, while `html` and `css` work in the front-end. 
I've also used bootstrap to build a few features such as the NAVBAR. Bootstrap came in handy during stylying the icons and buttons as well. 

To run this project, you can download the files and then, execute the `.html` file.
